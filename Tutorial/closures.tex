\chapter{Functional Programming and Closures \label{chapter:closures}}
We have already mentioned that \setlx\ is a full-fledged functional language:
Functions can be used both as arguments to other functions and as return values.  There is
no fundamental difference between the type of a function and, say, the type of a rational
number, as both can be assigned to variables, converted to strings, used as arguments of other
functions, or returned from a function.  

Additionaly, \setlx\ supports
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_science)}{\emph{closures}}
in a way similar to languages like \textsl{Scheme} \cite{sussman:75}. 
In order to introduce closures, we will first present some simple examples.  After that, we show
a more complex case study: We discuss a program that transforms a regular expression into a
non-deterministic finite state machine.

\section{Introductory Examples}
In this section we will first introduce the basic ideas of functional programming.
After that, we discuss the notion of a closure.

Using functions as arguments to other functions is something that is not often seen in
conventional programming languages.  Figure \ref{fig:reduce.stlx} on page \pageref{fig:reduce.stlx}
shows the implementation of the function \texttt{reduce} that takes two arguments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first argument is a list $l$.
\item The second argument is a binary function $f$.  This function is expected to take two
      arguments.
\end{enumerate}

                ]
    reduce := procedure(l, f) {
        match (l) {
            case []     : return;
            case [x]    : return x;
            case [x,y|r]: return reduce([f(x,y) | r], f);
        }    
    };
    add      := [x, y] |-> x + y;
    multiply := [x, y] |-> x * y;
    
    l := [1 .. 36];
    x := reduce(l, add     );
    y := reduce(l, multiply);
\end{Verbatim}

\caption{Implementing a second order function.}
\label{fig:reduce.stlx}
\end{figure}
The function \texttt{reduce} combines successive arguments of the list $l$ using the function $f$
and thereby reduces the list $l$ into a single value.  For example, if the function $f$ is the
function \texttt{add} that just adds its arguments, then $\texttt{reduce}(l,
\texttt{add})$ computes the sum of
the elements of $l$.  Therefore, in line 12 the invocation of
\texttt{reduce(l, add)} computes the sum of all elements of the list $l$.  Since this list 
contains the natural number from 1 up to 36, reduce effectively computes the sum
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
 $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{36} i$. 
\\[0.2cm] 
Note that the expression ``\texttt{+/ $l$}'' is another way to compute this sum.
If instead the second arguments of the function \texttt{reduce} is the function
\texttt{multiply} that returns the product of its arguments, then 
$\texttt{reduce}(l, \texttt{multiply})$ computes the product of all elements of the list
$l$ and hence is equivalent to the expression ``\texttt{*/ $l$}''.
Finally, it should be noted that in the case that the list $l$ is empty,
\texttt{reduce} returns the value \texttt{om}.

    s2 := sort(l, greater);
\end{Verbatim}
\vspace*{-0.3cm}
\caption{A generic sort function.}
\label{fig:merge-sort.stlx}
\end{figure}

Notice that the function \texttt{reduce} is a so called
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function}{higher order function} because  
one of its arguments is itself a function.  While the example given above might seem
artificial, there are common applications of this scheme.  One example is sorting.
Figure \ref{fig:merge-sort.stlx} on page \pageref{fig:merge-sort.stlx} shows a generic
implementation of the algorithm \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort}{\emph{merge sort}}.
Here, the function \texttt{sort} takes two arguments:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The first argument $l$ is the list to be sorted.
\item The second argument \texttt{cmp} is a binary function that compares two  elements
      and returns either \texttt{true} or \texttt{false}.  If we call the function
      \texttt{sort} with second argument \texttt{less}, where the function \texttt{less} is
      defined in line 20, then the resulting list will be sorted ascendingly.
      If instead we use the function \texttt{greater} defined in line 21 as the second
      argument, then the list $l$ will be sorted descendingly.

      The second argument \texttt{cmp} of the procedure \texttt{sort} enables us to sort a list that
      contains elements that are not numbers.  In order to do so, we just have to implement an
      appropriate version of the function \texttt{cmp}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Implementing Counters via Closures}
The concept of a closure is non-trivial, therefore we introduce the idea using some simple
examples.  Figure \ref{fig:counter-closure.stlx} shows the function
\texttt{createCounter}.  This function initializes the variable \texttt{count} to a given
value and then returns a procedure that increments this value.  Note that this procedure is not
defined via the keyword \texttt{procedure} but rather via the keyword \texttt{closure}.  The reason
is that this function needs access to the variable \texttt{count} that is defined outside of the
closure \texttt{counter}.  By defining the function \texttt{counter} as a \texttt{closure} rather
than as a \texttt{procedure},  the function \texttt{counter} has access to the variable \texttt{count}:
It can both read its value and can even change the value.  When the function \texttt{counter} is
defined, the variable \texttt{count} is safely tucked away together with the function
\texttt{counter}.  Therefore, although the variable \texttt{count} goes out of scope once the
function \texttt{createCounter} terminates, the function \texttt{counter} still has access
to a 
copy of this variable.  Hence, when we call the function \texttt{createCounter} in line 9, 
the variable \texttt{ctr0} is assigned a version of the function counter where the variable
\texttt{count} initially has the value 0.  Later, when we call the function \texttt{ctr0},
in line 12, this counter is incremented 3 times.  Therefore, after line 12 is executed,
the variables \texttt{u}, \texttt{v}, and \texttt{w} have the values $1$, $2$, and $3$,
respectively. 


\begin{figure}[!ht]
\centering
\begin{Verbatim}[ frame         = lines, 
                  framesep      = 0.3cm, 
                  firstnumber   = 1,
                  labelposition = bottomline,
                  numbers       = left,
                  numbersep     = -0.2cm,
                  xleftmargin   = 0.8cm,
                  xrightmargin  = 0.8cm,
                ]
    createCounter := procedure(i) {
        count   := i;
        counter := closure() {
                       count += 1;
                       return count;
                   };
        return counter;
    };   
    ctr0 := createCounter(0);
    ctr9 := createCounter(9);
    
    u := ctr0(); v := ctr0(); w := ctr0();
    x := ctr9(); y := ctr9(); z := ctr9();
\end{Verbatim}
\vspace*{-0.3cm}
\caption{Creating a counter as a closure.}
\label{fig:counter-closure.stlx}
\end{figure}

You should notice that the function \texttt{ctr9} created in line 10 gets its
\underline{own} copy of the variable \texttt{count}.  In the case of the function
\texttt{ctr9}, this copy of \texttt{count} is initialized with the value 9.  Therefore, after
we have called the function \texttt{ctr9} in line 13, the variables \texttt{x}, \texttt{y}, and
\texttt{z} will have the values $10$, $11$, and $12$. 


\subsection{Lambda Definitions for Closures}
There is a short-hand notation for the definition of a closure that can be used if the closure only
contains a single \texttt{return} statement. This short-hand notation relates to closures as lambda definitions relate to
procedures.  This short-hand notation is called a \emph{lambda closure}.  Here is a simple example:
The following two lines define a function \texttt{f} that computes the cube of its argument.
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm} \texttt{c := 3;}            \\
\hspace*{1.3cm} \texttt{f := x |=> x ** c;}
\\[0.2cm]
These two lines are equivalent to the following two lines:
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm} \texttt{c := 3;}            \\
\hspace*{1.3cm} \texttt{f := closure(x) \{ return x ** c; \};}
\\[0.2cm]
In general, the expression
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
\texttt{x |=> \textsl{expr}}
\\[0.2cm]
is equivalent to the following expression:
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
\texttt{closure(x) \{ return \textsl{expr}; \}}
\\[0.2cm]
If there is more than one argument to a closure, the arguments have to be enclosed in square
brackets.  For example, 
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
\texttt{f := [x,y] |=> sqrt(x ** c + y ** c);}
\\[0.2cm]
is equivalent to
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
\texttt{f := closure(x,y) \{ return sqrt(x ** c + y ** c); \};}

\subsection{Closures as Return Values}
So far, the functions we have discussed did not return functions.  The next example will change
that.  In mathematics, given a function
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$
\\[0.2cm]
mapping natural numbers into natural numbers, the 
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference}{\emph{discrete derivative}} of $f$ is again a
function mapping natural numbers to natural numbers and is denoted
as $\Delta f$.  For $n \in \mathbb{N}$, the value $(\Delta f)(n)$ is defined as
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$(\Delta f)(n) := f(n+1) - f(n)$.
\\[0.2cm]
For example, given the function $f: \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$ defined as $f(n) := 2^n$,
we have
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$(\Delta f)(n) = 2^{n+1} - 2^n = 2^n = f(n)$.
\\[0.2cm]
To give another example, the discrete derivative of the identity function is the function that
maps every natural number to the number $1$, since $(n+1) - n = 1$.

\begin{Verbatim}[ frame         = lines, 
                  framesep      = 0.3cm,

                  labelposition = bottomline,
                  numbers       = left,
                  numbersep     = -0.2cm,
                  xleftmargin   = 0.8cm,
                  xrightmargin  = 0.8cm,
                ]
    delta := procedure(f) {
        return n |=> f(n+1) - f(n);
    };    
    g := n |-> n;
    h := n |-> 2 ** n;
    deltaG := delta(g);
    deltaH := delta(h);
    
    print([ deltaG(n) : n in [1 .. 10]]);
    print([ deltaH(n) : n in [1 .. 10]]);
\end{Verbatim}
\vspace*{-0.3cm}
\caption{Computing the discrete derivative of a given function.}
\label{fig:finite-difference.stlx}
\end{figure}

\noindent
Figure \ref{fig:finite-difference.stlx} shows the implementation of the function \texttt{delta}
that takes a function \texttt{f} as input and then returns the discrete derivative of \texttt{f}.  In line 6
and 7, this function is applied to the identity function and to the function $n \mapsto 2^n$,
respectively.  The resulting functions \texttt{deltaG} and \texttt{deltaH} are then applied to
the sequence of natural numbers from 1 to 10.  In the first case, the result is a list
containing the number one ten times, while in the second case the the result is a list of the
first ten powers of two.

Note that we had to define the return value of the function \texttt{delta} as a closure.  The reason
is that otherwise the value \texttt{f} referring to the function would not be in the local scope of
the function that is returned by \texttt{delta} and hence \texttt{f} would be undefined.

\section[Closures in Action]{Closures in Action: Generating Finite State Machines from Regular Expressions}
In this section we demonstrate a non-trivial application of closures.  We present a program that
takes a regular expression $r$ as input and  converts this regular expression into a
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nondeterministic_finite_automaton}{\emph{non-deterministic finite state machine}} 
using the 
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson's_construction_algorithm}{\emph{Thompson construction}}
\cite{hopcroft:06}.  To this end, we first define a \emph{alphabet} as a finite set of characters.
Then, for the purpose of this section, \emph{regular expressions over an alphabet $\Sigma$} are
defined inductively as follows. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item Every character $c\in \Sigma$ is a regular expression matching exactly this character and
      nothing else.
\item If $r_1$ and $r_2$ are regular expressions,  then $r_1 \cdot r_2$ is a regular
      expression.  If $r_1$ matches the string $s_1$ and $r_2$ matches the string $s_2$,
      then $r_1 \cdot r_2$ matches the string $s_1s_2$, where $s_1s_2$ is understood as
      the concatenation of $s_1$ and $s_2$.
\item If $r_1$ and $r_2$ are regular expressions,  then $r_1 \mid r_2$ is a regular
      expression.  The regular expression $r_1 \mid r_2$ matches any string that is matched
      by either $r_1$ or $r_2$.
\item If $r$ is a regular expression, then $r^*$ is a regular expression.
      This regular expression matches the empty string and, furthermore, matches any string
      $s$ that can be decomposed as
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $s = t_1 t_2 \cdots t_n$
      \\[0.2cm]
      where each of the substrings $t_i$ is matched by the regular expression $r$.
\end{enumerate}
For the purpose of the program we are going to develop, composite regular expressions will be
represented by terms.  In detail, we have the following representation of regular
expressions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A regular expression $r$ of the form $r = c$ where $c\in \Sigma$ is represented the character $c$.
\item A regular expression $r$ of the form $r = r_1 \cdot r_2$ is represented by the term
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      \texttt{@Cat(r1, r2)}
      \\[0.2cm]
      where \texttt{r1} is the representation of $r_1$ and \texttt{r2} is the
      representation of $r_2$.  The name \texttt{Cat} reminds us of con\underline{cat}enation. 
\item A regular expression $r$ of the form $r = r_1 \mid r_2$ is represented by the term
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      \texttt{@Or(r1, r2)}
      \\[0.2cm]
      where \texttt{r1} is the representation of $r_1$ and \texttt{r2} is the
      representation of $r_2$.
\item A regular expression $r$ of the form $r = r_0^*$ is represented by the term
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      \texttt{@Star(r0)}
      \\[0.2cm]
      where \texttt{r0} is the representation of $r_0$. 
\end{enumerate}
The \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson%27s_construction_algorithm}{\emph{Thompson construction}}
of a non-deterministic finite state machine from a given regular 
expression $r$ works by induction on the structure of $r$.  Given a regular expression
$r$,  we define a non-deterministic finite state machine $A(r)$ by induction on $r$.
For the purpose of this section, a finite state machine $A$ is a 4-tuple
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$A = \langle Q, \delta, q_0, q_f \rangle$
\\[0.2cm]
where $Q$ is the set of states, 
$\delta$ is the transition function and maps a pair $\langle q, c \rangle$ where $q$ is a
state and $c$ is a character to a set of new states.  If we denote the set of characters
as $\Sigma$, then the function $\delta$ has the signature
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
$\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow 2^Q$.
\\[0.2cm]
The understanding  of $\delta(q,c)$ is that if the finite state machine $A$ is in the
state $q$ and reads the character $c$, then it can switch to any of the states in
$\delta(q,c)$.
Finally, $q_0$ is the start state and $q_f$ is the accepting state.  In the following, we
abbreviate the notion of a  
\emph{finite state machine} as fsm.
\begin{enumerate}
\item For a letter $c$ the fsm $A(c)$ is defined as
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $A(c) = \langle \{ q_0, q_1 \}, 
                      \{ \langle q_0, c \rangle \mapsto q_1\}, q_0, q_1  \rangle$.
      \\[0.2cm]
      The set of states is given as $\{ q_0, q_1 \}$, on reading the character $c$ the
      transition function maps the state $q_0$ to $q_1$, the start state is $q_0$ and the
      accepting state is $q_1$.  This fsm is shown in Figure
      \ref{fig:aChar.eps}.  The start state $q_0$ is marked by an incoming arrow, while the
      accepting state $q_1$ is marked by a doubled boundary.

      \label{fig:genCharNFA.stlx}
      \end{figure}

      Figure \ref{fig:genCharNFA.stlx} shows the function \texttt{genCharNFA} that takes a
      character $c$ and generates the fsm $A(c)$.  The code corresponds to the
      diagram shown in Figure \ref{fig:aChar.eps}.
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item We generate two new states $q_0$ and $q_1$ using the function
            \texttt{getNewState}.  The implementation of this function is shown in Figure
            \ref{fig:getNewState.stlx} on page \pageref{fig:getNewState.stlx}.  Every time this
            function is called, it creates a new unique string that is interpreted as a state.
      \item The transition function checks whether the state $q$ given as input is equal
            to the start state $q_0$ and whether, furthermore, the character $d$ that is
            read is identical to the character $c$.  If this is the case, the fsm switches
            into the state $q_1$ and therefore the set of possible next states is the singleton
            set $\{ q_1 \}$.  Since this is the only transition of the fsm, in all other
            cases the set of next states is empty.
      \end{enumerate}
      
\item In order to compute the fsm $A(r_1 \cdot r_2)$ 
      we have to assume that the sets of states of the fsms
      $A(r_1)$ and $A(r_2)$ are disjoint.  This is true since the function \texttt{getNewState} does
      create a new state every time it is called.
      Let us assume that the fsms  $A(r_1)$ and $A(r_2)$ have the following form:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item $A(r_1) = \langle Q_1, \delta_1, q_1, q_2 \rangle$,
      \item $A(r_2) = \langle Q_2, \delta_2, q_3, q_4 \rangle$, \quad where
      \item $Q_1 \cap Q_2 = \{\}$.
      \end{enumerate}
      Using $A(r_1)$ and $A(r_2)$ we construct the fsm $A(r_1 \cdot r_2)$ as
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{0.8cm}
       $\langle Q_1 \cup Q_2, \Sigma, 
                \{ \pair(q_2,\varepsilon) \mapsto q_3 \} 
                   \cup \delta_1 \cup \delta_2, q_0, q_4 \rangle$
      \\[0.2cm]
      The notation $\{ \pair(q_2,\varepsilon) \mapsto q_3 \} \cup \delta_1 \cup \delta_2$
      specifies that the transition function $\delta$ contains all the transitions
      from the transition functions  $\delta_1$ and $\delta_2$.  Additionally,
      there is an  $\varepsilon$-transition from $q_2$ to
      $q_3$.  Formally, the transition function could also be specified as follows:
      \\[0.2cm]
      \hspace*{1.3cm}
      $\delta(q,c) := \left\{
      \begin{array}{ll}
        \{ q_3 \}       & \mbox{if $q = q_2$ and $c = \varepsilon$}, \\[0.2cm]
        \delta_1(q, c)  & \mbox{if $q \in Q_1$ and $\pair(q,c) \not= \pair(q_2,\varepsilon)$}, \\[0.2cm]
        \delta_2(q, c)  & \mbox{if $q \in Q_2$.} 
      \end{array}\right.
      $

Figure \ref{fig:getNewState.stlx} shows the procedure \texttt{getNewState} that is used to create
new states.  Since the parameter \texttt{ctr} of this procedure is preceded by the keyword
\texttt{rw}, this parameter has a \emph{call-by-name} semantics and therefore the procedure
\texttt{getNewState} is able to increment this variable.  Hence, the states generated
by \texttt{getNewState} are unique.

Finally, Figure \ref{fig:regexp2NFA.stlx} shows how to generate a finite state machine
from a given regular expression $r$.  The function $\texttt{regexp2NFA}(r)$ is defined by
recursion on $r$:
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $r$ is a single character $c$, then the fsm $A(c)$ is computed using
      the function $\texttt{genCharNFA}(c)$.
\item If $r = r_1 \cdot r_2$, the function \texttt{regexp2NFA} recursively computes
      finite state machines $A(r_1)$ and $A(r_2)$.  These fsms are then combined
      using the function $\texttt{catenate}\bigr(A(r_1), A(r_2)\bigr)$.
\item If $r = r_1 + r_2$, the function \texttt{regexp2NFA} recursively computes
      finite state machines $A(r_1)$ and $A(r_2)$.  These fsms are then combined
      using the function $\texttt{disjunction}\bigr(A(r_1), A(r_2)\bigr)$.
\item If $r = r_0^*$, the function \texttt{regexp2NFA} recursively computes
      the finite state machines $A(r_0)$.  This fsm is then transformed
      using the function $\texttt{kleene}\bigr(A(r_0)\bigr)$.
\end{enumerate}
The reader should note that we have made heavy use of closures to implement the functions
\texttt{genCharNFA}, \texttt{catenate}, \texttt{disjunction}, and \texttt{kleene}.

Let us take a step back and consider what we have achieved so far.  We have implemented a function
for converting regular expressions to non-deterministic finite state machines.
It is rather straightforward to implement a function that scans a given string using a non-deterministic
finite state machine. If we would implement this function, we would then have implemented our own
support for regular expressions.

\section{Decorators \label{sec:decorators}}
The programming language \href{https://www.python.org}{\textsl{Python}} has a nice feature called 
\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_syntax_and_semantics#Decorators}{\emph{decorators}} that
makes it easy to modify existing functions.  For example, a \emph{trace decorator} is a function that can
modify a given function $f$ so that every invocation of the function $f$ and every value returned by
the function $f$ are automatically traced.  \setlx\ supports similar techniques as \textsl{Python} and,
therefore, it is easy to implement decorators in \setlx, too.  In this section, we show how a simple
albeit powerful trace decorator can be implemented in just a few lines of \setlx\ code.

    };

\label{fig:trace-decorator-use.stlx}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:trace-decorator.stlx} on page \pageref{fig:trace-decorator.stlx} shows the class
\texttt{tracer}.  While classes will be discussed in full detail in a later chapter, it is convenient 
to use them for this example.
This class \texttt{tracer} implements a trace decorator.  Before we discuss the details of its
implementation, lets us show how this decorator is used.  Figure \ref{fig:trace-decorator-use.stlx}
shows the implementation of the function \texttt{gcd} computing the greatest common divisor of two
natural numbers using the \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm}{Euclidean algorithm}.
Suppose we want to trace every invocation of the function \texttt{gcd}.  We do so by first creating
an object of class \texttt{tracer} in line 7 of Figure \ref{fig:trace-decorator-use.stlx}.  Then the line
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
\texttt{gcd := myTracer.trace(gcd, "gcd");}
\\[0.2cm]
activates tracing for the function \texttt{gcd}.  Note that the first argument of the method
\texttt{trace} is the function we want to trace, while the second argument is the name of the function.
After executing this assignment statement, the function \texttt{gcd} will be traced.
For example, the call \texttt{gcd(36, 27)} produces the following output:
\begin{verbatim}
    calling gcd(36, 27)
    calling gcd(27, 9)
    calling gcd(9, 0)
    gcd(9, 0) = 9
    gcd(27, 9) = 9
    gcd(36, 27) = 9
    ~< Result: 9 >~
\end{verbatim}
This shows that every time the function \texttt{gcd} is called, a statement of the form
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
\texttt{calling gcd($m$, $n$)}
\\[0.2cm]
is printed.  This is true even for the recursive invocations of \texttt{gcd}.  Furthermore,
every time the function \texttt{gcd} returns a result, this is also printed together with the
arguments used to compute this result.

To stop tracing the function \texttt{gcd}, we simply issue the statement:
\\[0.2cm]
\hspace*{1.3cm}
\texttt{gcd := myTracer.untrace("gcd");}
\\[0.2cm]
After this assignment, the function \texttt{gcd} is restored to its original state and will not print
anything when called.

\end{figure}

Let us proceed to discuss how the class \texttt{tracer} is implemented in \setlx.  Figure
\ref{fig:trace-decorator.stlx} shows the implementation of this class.  We discuss this
implementation line by line.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Line 2 defines the member variable \texttt{mStoredProcedures}.  This variable will store a map
      that is represented as a binary relation.  The keys of this maps are procedure names, while the
      values entered into this map are the procedures themselves.  Initially, this map is empty.  Every time a
      procedure is traced, the old value of the procedure is stored in this map.  This is needed in
      order to implement the method \texttt{untrace} that restores a given procedure to its original
      state.
\item The workhorse of the class \texttt{tracer} is the method \texttt{trace} defined in line 4.
      This method takes two arguments:  The first argument is a procedure, while the second argument
      is the name of the procedure.  The function will return a new procedure that behaves like the
      given procedure but, furthermore, traces the invocation of the original procedure as discussed
      previously in the example.  The procedure \texttt{trace} works as follows:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item In line 5, the old value of the procedure to be traced is saved in the dictionary 
            \\[0.2cm]
            \hspace*{1.3cm}
            \texttt{mStoredProcedures}.
            \\[0.2cm]
            This value is needed to restore the procedure to its original value when we do not want
            to trace the procedure any more.
      \item Next, line 6 defines a closure called \texttt{tracedFunction}.  This is a function    
            called with a variable number of arguments.  The reason is that we do
            not know how many 
            arguments the procedure \texttt{function} that is given as argument to the method
            \texttt{trace} actually takes.  In the example discussed above, we had traced the
            function \texttt{gcd} that takes two arguments.  We could just as well have traced a
            procedure taking only one argument as we could have traced a procedure taking nine
            arguments.
      \item In line 7 and 8, the closure \texttt{tracedFunction} constructs a string containing the
            arguments and the name of the function and then prints this string.  This
            \texttt{tracedFunction} refers to \texttt{function} and \texttt{functionName}.  As these
            variables  are only defined in the method \texttt{trace}, the function \texttt{tracedFunction} needs to
            be defined as a \texttt{closure} so that it can access these variables.
      \item Line 9 is the most important line of the whole implementation:  It is here that the
            original procedure is called with the given arguments.  Note how prefixing the list of
            arguments \texttt{args} with the operator ``\texttt{*}'' makes it possible to call this
            function without knowing how many arguments the procedure actually takes.
      \item Line 10 prints the result that has been computed.
      \item This result is then returned in line 11.
      \item Finally, the method \texttt{trace} returns the newly created closure.  By assigning this
            closure to the name of the original procedure we can thus trace this procedure.
      \end{enumerate}
\item As a convenience, the class \texttt{tracer} also provides the method \texttt{untrace} in
      line 16.  This procedure looks up the original procedure stored under the given name in the
      dictionary \texttt{mStoredProcedures} and returns it.  Hence, assigning the value returned by
      this procedure to the name of a procedure stops tracing this procedure.
\end{enumerate}
