\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  In the late sixties, Jack Schwartz, a renowned professor of mathematics at the Courant Institute for
Mathematical Sciences in New York, developed a very high level programming language called
\textsc{Setl} 
\cite{schwartz:1970, setl86}.  The most distinguishing feature of this language is the
support it offers for sets and lists.   This feature permits convenient implementations of
mathematical algorithms:  As set theory is the language of mathematics, many mathematical
algorithms that are formulated in terms of set theory have very straightforward implementations in
\textsc{Setl}. 

Unfortunately, at the time of its invention, \textsc{Setl} did not get the attention that it deserved.
One of the main reasons was that \textsc{Setl} is an interpreted language and in those
days, the run time overhead of an interpreter loop was not yet affordable.  More than
forty years after the first conception of \textsc{Setl}, the efficiency of computers has changed
dramatically and for many applications, the run time efficiency of a languange is no
longer as important as it once was.  After all, 
modern scripting languages like Python \cite{vanRossum:95} or Ruby \cite{flanagan:2008}
are all interpreted and noticeably slower than compiled languages like \texttt{C}, but this
fact hasn't impeded their success. 

While teaching at the Baden-Württemberg Corporate State University,  the first author had used
\textsc{Setl2} \cite{snyder90b} at 
for several years in a number of introductory computer science courses.  He had
noticed that the adoption of \textsc{Setl} had made the abstract concepts of set theory
more accesible to the students.   Nevertheless, as the original version of
\textsc{Setl} is more than forty years old, it has a number of shortcomings.  
One minor issue is the fact, that the syntax is quite dated and has proven difficult to
master  for students that are mainly acquainted with \texttt{C} and \textsl{Java}.
Furthermore,  \textsc{Setl} lacks any immediate support for first order terms.  Therefore, 
\textsc{Setl} has been extended into the new language \textsc{SetlX}.  The main features that have
been changed or added are as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textsc{SetlX} supports terms in a way similar to the language \textsl{Prolog}.  In
      particular, \textsc{SetlX} supports matching.  This makes \textsc{SetlX} well suited 
      for symbolic computations.
\item \textsc{SetlX} supports several ideas from functional programming.  In particular,
      functions can be used as a primitive data type.  Furthermore, \textsc{SetlX}
      supports \emph{closures} and the \emph{memoization} of functions.
\item \textsc{SetlX} has support for regular expressions.
\item \textsc{SetlX} provides backtracking.
\item \textsc{SetlX} supports object oriented programming concepts.
\item \textsc{SetlX} provides a small set of graphical primitives that support
      the animation of algorithms.
\item Lastly, while \textsc{Setl} has a syntax that is reminiscent of Algol,
      \textsc{SetlX} has a syntax that is more akin to languages like \texttt{C} or
      \textsl{Java}.  
\end{itemize}
The language \textsc{SetlX} has been implemented by Tom Herrmann as part of his student
research project.  Fortunately, for the time being he continues to maintain the language
and even implements new features.
