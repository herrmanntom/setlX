 + allow to access relations with multiple parameters without explicitly wrapping those
   parameters into a list, e.g.

   may now be written as
   r[a,b] := 1; print(r[a,b]);
 + added specification of optional and unlimited parameters for procedures, closures and classes

   a list of pairs, one from each list
 + implemented closures as special kind of procedure for future use; currently
   closures work exactly like normal procedures

 + updated to antlr 4.2
 # fixed closure behavior with cachedProcedures calling themselves recursively
 * as 'closure' is now a keyword, code using it as an identifier will break

---v2.1.1--- 2013-07-27
 + the single straight quote is now used as escape character in literals and the
   only valid escape sequence is two quotes ('') as sequence for a single one (')
 - the quote operator (@) looses its special meaning for double-quoted strings;
   it will now only force a term creation; to get the old behavior on strings,
